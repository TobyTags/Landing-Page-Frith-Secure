            <p>Have you ever thought about how much your online presence makes you vulnerable to social engineering?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Trying to understand your digital presence is currently very fragmented and difficult, doing it yourself and understanding your exposure takes a lot of time!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Frith Secureâ€™s proposal is to be a one stop shop for securing your digital online presence, lock down your media, map your risks, and help you to be more secure. </p>
